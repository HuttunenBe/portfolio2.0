# 🚀 Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio! Creating a portfolio page was part of my CSS course, but I wasn’t fully satisfied with how to original one turned out. So I decided to start over with a better design and more personal feel. This project gave me opportunity to dive deeper into animations. It’s amazing to see how few months really make a difference in CSS skills! ✨

For this project I paid close attention on keeping the code clean and well structured. Paying as much attention to details as possible. Along the way I challenged myself to commit more frequently to GitHub. 

I did face some challenges, such as animations overlapping each others and ensuring the mobile responsiveness. Moving forward, I’d like to improve the design in the About section and add more advanced animations.
