# 🚀 Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio! This is an ongoing project that I’m actively working on. Creating a portfolio page was part of my CSS course, but I wasn’t fully satisfied with how to original one turned out. Right now I’m improving the previous portfolio with a better design and a more personal feel. It’s amazing to see how few months really make a difference in CSS skills! ✨
